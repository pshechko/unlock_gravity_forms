# unlock_gravity_forms
The small code allows you to fix bug with Gravity Forms locking. 
Just paste the content of functions.php from the repo to your theme's functions.php or plugin file.
The code adds an admin notification with the button that allows you to unlock GF.
Warning! Do not try to unlock GF from the GF pages (like form edit page or settings page)
