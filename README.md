# Unlock Gravity Forms
There can se some erros with GF, e.g. 'These settings are currently locked. Click on the Request Control button to let mc know you'd like to take over.' The code adds an admin notification with the button that allows you to unlock GF. Just paste the content of functions.php from the repo to your theme's functions.php or plugin file.

Warning! Do not try to unlock GF from the GF pages (like form edit page or settings page)
